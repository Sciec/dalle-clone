Note- 
1. To change the name of the branch from the master to main in the local repo, we use -M flag.
 
  ' git branch -M main '

2. When you change something in the remote repository and is not yet reflected to local repo, you must pull the changes before pushing anything.

  ' git pull --rebase origin main '

then all the changes made to local repo is can be pushed to the remote repository.

  ' git push -u origin main '
